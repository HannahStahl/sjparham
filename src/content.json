    "From the moment a very young Steve found a 1920’s era Kodak in his grandmother’s closet, he has been fascinated with photography.  During a visit to the New York World’s Fair in 1964, Steve paid his cousin $8 for a hand-me-down Braun 35mm camera with a scratched lens and turned toward photographing street life in the city.  A camera has been with him ever since as he has traveled Asia, Europe, and across America.",
    "Steve Parham is a natural-born wanderer—seeking moments here and there—fleeting, elusive—stories that evoke some memory or feeling or curiosity.  Maybe it’s autumnal colors emerging through fog at the first rays of sunrise, or the weathered scowl of a soldier close to his own fade.  Maybe it’s old tools—banged up, chipped, scarred—working man’s tools that built and fixed and passed through three generation of hands.",
    "For Steve, that’s what photography is—stories, places, people—life caught in the moment, fixed in time."
